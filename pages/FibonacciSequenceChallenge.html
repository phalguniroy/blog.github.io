<h4>The most effective way of making habit and working towards goals.</h4>
<hr>

<h4>Why there is need of FibonacciSequenceChallenge when there are already so many challenges already?</h4>
<p>
To learn new things or mastery a subject we need to put effort daily and after some period of time, we will get the result. So <b>consistency</b> is the key to mastery or getting good at something very well.</p>
<hr>
<h5>So, how to devlop consistency?</h5>
<p>
Before that let us understand why we are addicted towards social media, whatsap, youtube and other platforms.</p>
<p>
The answer is instant gratification. When we use these kinds of app, We immediately get the reward as a feel-good chemical known as dopamine released in our brain.</p>
<p>
	When we get likes on Facebook or watch comedy video on youtube we feel good and as a rewarding brain gets the dopamine. So it connects the activity with pleasure and craves for it to feel good. As a result the activity turn into a habit. We classify it as bad as it is not productive for us. 
	<br>
	<br>
activity + instant dopamine = habit</p>
<p>
	On the other hand learning or studying a subject for long time doest not give instant reward but give us necessary things which are really good for us.

For example: eating healthy and exercise daily will give us good health, journalling help us to Keep our thoughts organized and monitor our progress, etc.</p>
